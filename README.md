# Husky Demo App

Welcome to the Husky Demo App repository! This project is built using Vite with the React TypeScript template and includes configuration for pre-commit hooks using Husky.

## Overview

This demo app is a minimalistic React application scaffolded with Vite, a fast development build tool. It showcases the integration of Husky for pre-commit hooks to automate tasks like linting and formatting before committing your code.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

-   Node.js (v14 or higher)
-   npm (Node Package Manager)

### Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ManishPJha/husky-demo-app.git
    cd husky-demo-app
    ```

2. Install Dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Available Scripts

You can run the following npm scripts:

-   `npm run dev`: Start the development server with Vite.
-   `npm run build`: Build the project for production.
-   `npm run format`: Format code using Prettier.
-   `npm run lint`: Lint your TypeScript and React code using ESLint.
-   `npm run preview`: Preview the production build locally.

### Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses Husky and lint-staged to enforce code quality checks before committing. When you run `git commit`, Husky will automatically run the configured tasks for you.

The pre-commit configuration is defined in the `.husky/pre-commit` file. Here's what it does:

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

npx lint-staged
```

It runs `lint-staged`, which in turn runs ESLint and Prettier on the files that are about to be committed.
